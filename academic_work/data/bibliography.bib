@article{becker:2020:what_is_game_balancing,
  abstract   = {Balancing is commonly considered critical to any game's success. However, there is no consensus on what ``game balancing'' actually means. This paper examines fourteen publications by experienced game designers and other renowned authors. The results of a formal semantic analysis of the respective authors' reflections prove that no two authors share identical understandings of ``game balancing.'' Their differing concepts of the term are analyzed and discussed in order to identify key aspects, similarities, and differences. Contrary to what one might expect, concepts such as fairness, flow, or user satisfaction are identified to be important, but no central or fundamental concepts for the definition of game balancing.},

@article{holmgard:2019:automated_playtesting_procedural_personas,
  abstract = {This paper describes a method for generative player modeling and its application to the automatic testing of game content using archetypal player models called procedural personas. Theoretically grounded in psychological decision theory, procedural personas are implemented using a variation of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) where the node selection criteria are developed using evolutionary computation, replacing the standard UCB1 criterion of MCTS. Using these personas, we demonstrate how generative player models can be applied to a varied corpus of game levels and demonstrate how different playstyles can be enacted in each level. In short, we use artificially intelligent personas to construct synthetic playtesters. The proposed approach could be used as a tool for automatic play testing when human feedback is not readily available or when quick visualization of potential interactions is necessary. Possible applications include interactive tools during game development or procedural content generation systems where many evaluations must be conducted within a short time span.},

Experimental results show that in several domains, UCT is significantly more efficient than its alternatives.},

Arguably the most popular iteration, Match-3 games, are simple to understand puzzle games, making them great benchmarks for research. In this paper, we propose developing different procedural personas for Match-3 games in order to approximate different human playstyles to create an automated playtest system. The procedural personas are realized through evolving the utility function for the Monte Carlo Tree Search agent. We compare the performance and results of the evolution agents with the standard Vanilla Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation as well as to a random move-selection agent. We then observe the impacts on both the game's design and the game design process. Lastly, a user study is performed to compare the agents to human play traces.},

Throughout the book, relevant topics on the use of spreadsheet programs will be included in each chapter.

  abstract  = {Ticket to Ride is a popular contemporary board game for two to four players, featuring a number of expansions with additional maps and tweaks to the core game mechanics. In this paper, four different game-playing agents that embody different playing styles are defined and used to analyze Ticket to Ride. Different playing styles are shown to be effective depending on the map and rule variation, and also depending on how many players play the game. The performance profiles of the different agents can be used to characterize maps and identify the most similar maps in the space of playstyles. Further analysis of the automatically played games reveal which cities on the map are most desirable, and that the relative attractiveness of cities is remarkably consistent across numbers of players. Finally, the automated analysis also reveals two classes of failures states, where the agents find states which are not covered by the game rules; this is akin to finding bugs in the rules. We see the analysis performed here as a possible template for AI-based playtest of contemporary board games.},

  abstract = {The game of chess is the longest-studied domain in the history of artificial intelligence. The strongest programs are based on a combination of sophisticated search techniques, domain-specific adaptations, and handcrafted evaluation functions that have been refined by human experts over several decades. By contrast, the AlphaGo Zero program recently achieved superhuman performance in the game of Go by reinforcement learning from selfplay. In this paper, we generalize this approach into a single AlphaZero algorithm that can achieve superhuman performance in many challenging games. Starting from random play and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero convincingly defeated a world champion program in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go.},
